Computable registry of architectural decisions. Each ADR is versioned in Git, cryptographically signed, validated against a strict schema, evaluated by OPA policy, and exported as JSON for AI agent consumption and programmatic governance enforcement.

> **Beta** — The project has reached Beta. The cryptographic blockchain layer, advanced CLI, OPA policy validation, Temporal Anchoring (OpenTimestamps), Bitcoin-compatible secp256k1 receipts, SBOM governance, and 80+ MCP tools are operational in the Nix environment. Cross-platform non-Nix support is currently in progress.

## Why it exists

Architectural decisions tend to scatter — Notion, Slack, the memory of whoever was in the room. When someone asks "why NixOS?", the answer is reconstructed from fragments, if at all.

ADR Ledger treats decisions as structured data: YAML frontmatter for machines, Markdown for humans, Git as an audit trail, and cryptographic chains for immutability. Five autonomous agents consume this knowledge:

| Agent | Function | Consumes |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **CEREBRO** | RAG Retrieval & Knowledge Vault | `knowledge_base.json` |
| **SPECTRE** | Pattern & Sentiment Analysis (NLP) | `spectre_corpus.json` |
| **PHANTOM** | ML Classification & Sanitization | `phantom_training.json` |
| **NEUTRON** | Declarative Infra & Compliance | ADR compliance tags |
| **IntelSense** | Security Ops & Intelligence (OSINT) | Security tagged ADRs |

The result: decisions that are traceable, versioned, cryptographically verifiable, and queryable by both humans and machines.

## SecureLLM-MCP Integration

ADR Ledger is the foundational knowledge layer for the **SecureLLM-MCP** ecosystem. It provides over **80+ native MCP tools** enabling autonomous agents to interact with the system architecture deeply and securely:

- **Provider & API Management:** LLM connectivity testing, TLS generation.
- **Emergency Framework:** CPU/Memory/SWAP rescue operations, thermal protection.
- **Laptop Defense Framework:** Thermal forensics, rebuild safety checks.
- **Code Analysis:** Deep AST debugging, complexity metrics, dead code detection.
- **Browser Automation:** Web research, scraping, form interaction.
- **Secure Execution:** Ephemeral Nix sandboxes for safe command execution.

Agents can natively query the ADR Ledger, validate new proposals against existing `knowledge_base.json`, and enforce rules during CI/CD.

## Quick Start

### NixOS / Nix (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcosfpina/adr-ledger.git
cd adr-ledger
nix develop          # enters devShell, provisions Python, hooks, and deps
adr list
adr list --delivery-status completed
adr new -t "My Decision" -p CEREBRO -c major
adr validate
adr policy-check
adr bitcoin list
adr sync
```

### Linux (non-Nix)

Requires: `bash`, `python3.13`, `pyyaml`, `pynacl`, `jsonschema`, `git`, `opa`, `openssl`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcosfpina/adr-ledger.git
cd adr-ledger

# Install Python deps
pip install pyyaml pynacl jsonschema

# Install CLI and git hooks
bash scripts/install.sh

# Usage
adr list
adr new -t "Adopt Redis" -p SPECTRE -c major
bash scripts/opa-validate.sh
./scripts/phantom-scan-check.sh .
adr sync
```

---

## Validation Pipeline

The default validator is now layered:

1. `scripts/validate_adr.py` merges YAML frontmatter with Markdown sections and validates against `.schema/adr.schema.json`.
2. `scripts/opa-validate.sh` evaluates each ADR through `policies/adr/validation.rego`.
3. `.chain/bitcoin_attestation.py` verifies local secp256k1 snapshot receipts under `.chain/bitcoin/receipts/`.

The main entrypoints are:

```bash
adr validate
adr policy-check
adr bitcoin verify-all
```

Implementation details and tradeoffs are documented in [docs/VALIDATION.md](docs/VALIDATION.md).

## Workflow

### Scenario 1: New Decision & Cryptographic Pre-Signing

```bash
# Propose a new architecture change
$ adr new -t "Add Redis for API Caching" -p SPECTRE -c critical

# Critical ADRs require multi-sig (e.g., Architect + Security Lead)
$ adr pre-sign ADR-0042
# Generates a pending signature block in .chain/pending_signatures/

# After all required approvals, accept the ADR into the ledger
$ adr accept ADR-0042

# Sync agents, rebuild the Merkle tree, and check SBOM drift
$ adr sync
```

### Scenario 2: Temporal Anchoring (OpenTimestamps)

```bash
# Anchor the current blockchain state to the Bitcoin blockchain for immutable proof
$ adr anchor
# Output: Creating OpenTimestamps proof for chain height 42...
```

### Scenario 3: Policy Validation (OPA)

```bash
# Evaluate ADRs against the local governance policy bundle
$ adr policy-check
# Output: hard denies fail the command, soft warnings are printed per ADR.
```

### Scenario 4: Bitcoin-compatible Snapshot Receipt

```bash
# Generate local secp256k1 key material for attestations
$ adr bitcoin keygen --name kernelcore

# Sign the latest snapshot receipt
$ adr bitcoin attest --signer kernelcore

# Verify every receipt currently stored
$ adr bitcoin verify-all
```

### Scenario 5: Supply Chain Governance (SBOM)

```bash
# Check if current flake.lock dependencies drift from the accepted ADRs
$ adr sbom
# Output: Validating CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM... No drift detected.
```

---

## Governance as Code

Governance is automated, not a manual process. Defined in `.governance/governance.yaml`:

### Compliance Automation

The system uses Git hooks (Pre-commit/Post-commit) to enforce:
- **Approval Matrix**: `critical` requires 2 signatures (Architect + Security Lead).
- **Compliance Triggers**: ADRs modifying `data` layers automatically require the `LGPD` tag.
- **Supply Chain Drift**: `post-commit` verifies if new Nix flake inputs map to an accepted ADR.
- **Integrity**: Validates the private blockchain Merkle root against tampered markdown files.

```yaml
compliance:
  lgpd:
    trigger_keywords: ["PII", "personal data", "user data"]
    required_tags: ["LGPD"]
    required_sections: ["data_retention"]
    required_reviewer_role: "security_lead"

chain:
  require_signatures: true
  merkle_tree:
    enabled: true
  supply_chain:
    drift_detection:
      enabled: true
      check_on_commit: true
```

## ADR Schema

Each ADR is validated against `.schema/adr.schema.json`:

```yaml
---
